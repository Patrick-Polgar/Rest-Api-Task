Hi, Mr. Martin!

Just how I think this exercise to continue short and concise:

1.) We should finish first the mongodb database tasks

2.) We should write python codes to the Website functions (Questions & Answers)

3.) Test together the Database, Server and all backen functions (even so debugging)

4.) Bonuspart: Try to create some Frontend development with Javascript, Html and maybe some CSS


It would be a nice exercise to create together a little bit beginner full-stack task :))

Nice to meet you and thank you very much for your helpful teaching and collaboration!

Greetings,

Patrick
